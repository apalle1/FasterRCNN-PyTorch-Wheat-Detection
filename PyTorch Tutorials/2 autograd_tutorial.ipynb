If you set its attribute ``.requires_grad`` as ``True``, it starts to track all operations on it. When you finish your computation you can call ``.backward()`` and have all the gradients computed automatically. The gradient for this tensor will be\n","accumulated into ``.grad`` attribute.***\n","\n","***To stop a tensor from tracking history, you can call ``.detach()`` to detach\n","it from the computation history, and to prevent future computation from being\n","tracked.***\n","\n","To prevent tracking history (and using memory), you can also wrap the code block\n","in ``with torch.no_grad():``.
